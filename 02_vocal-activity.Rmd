# Vocal activity

In this script, we examine differences in vocal activity between dawn and dusk for each species. 

## Install necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(ggstatsplot)
```

## Load acoustic data and species scientific names data
```{r}
acoustic_data <- read.csv("results/acoustic_data.csv")
species_codes <- read.csv("data/species-annotation-codes.csv")
```

## Vocal activity across time periods

A number of factors need to be considered in further analysis: accounting for time_of_day, observed_identity for example. However, we run analyses that account for differences in calling activity by species for dawn and dusk.

```{r}
# total number of acoustic detections summarized across every 10-s audio file
vocal_act <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day, eBird_codes) %>%
  summarise(detections = sum(number)) %>%
  left_join(., species_codes[,c(1,2,5)], 
                       by = "eBird_codes") %>%
   group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  mutate(total_detections =sum(detections)) %>%
  mutate(percent_detections = (detections/total_detections)*100) %>%
  ungroup()

# for further analysis, we remove species that were detected less than 20 times cumulatively across dawn and dusk
# this ensures that we keep species that called very few times in the morning and perhaps more times in the evening, or vice-versa

vocal_act <- vocal_act %>%
  filter(total_detections > 20) 
 
# now, we end up with a total of 100 species (removing 25 species)

# for the sake of plotting, we will create a new variable 
vocal_act$plot_percent <- ifelse(vocal_act$time_of_day == "dawn",
                                 -1*vocal_act$percent_detections,
                                 vocal_act$percent_detections)

# figure of percent detections
fig_percent_detections <- ggplot(vocal_act, aes(
            x = reorder(common_name, desc(common_name)),
                               y = plot_percent,
                               fill = time_of_day)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=signif(abs(plot_percent),3)),
            hjust = ifelse(vocal_act$plot_percent >= 0, 0, 1),
            size = 3) +
