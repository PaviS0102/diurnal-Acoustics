# Territoriality
  
In this script, we examine the role of territoriality in vocal activity between dawn and dusk. The expectation is that highly territorial, weakly territorial and non-territorial species have higher vocal activity in dawn than dusk.

Highly territorial species are those which defend and maintain their territories throughout the year. Weakly territorial species are those which have broadly overlapping home ranges, or sometimes join mixed flocks without defined spatial ranges. Non-territorial species are those which do not defend territories, or defend very small areas around nest sites, or defend song or display posts only.

## Load acoustic data and species scientific names data
```{r}
acoustic_data <- read.csv("results/acoustic_data.csv")
species_codes <- read.csv("data/species-annotation-codes.csv")
```

## Filtering acoustic data to ensure sampling periods are even across dawn and dusk  

Since our recording schedule was uneven (6am to 10am in the morning and 4pm to 7pm in th evening), we filter acoustic data to retain recordings between 6am and 830am and recordings made between 4pm and 630pm so that the two sampling windows capture a similar amount of time right after dawn and right before dusk. 

```{r}
dawn <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day =="dawn") %>%
  filter(start_time >= 060000 & start_time <= 083000)
  
dusk <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day == "dusk") %>%
  filter(start_time >= 160000 & start_time <= 183000)

acoustic_data <- bind_rows(dawn[,-10], dusk[,-10])
```

## Vocal activity across time periods

A number of factors need to be considered in further analysis: accounting for time_of_day, observed_identity for example. However, we run analyses that account for differences in calling activity by species for dawn and dusk.

```{r}
# sampling effort by time_of_day
effort <- acoustic_data %>%
  dplyr::select(site_id, date, time_of_day) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(time_of_day) %>%
  count(time_of_day) %>%
  rename(., nVisits = n)

# Above, we note that we had sampled ~293 site-date combinations at dawn, while ~245 site-date combinations were sampled at dusk

# total number of acoustic detections summarized across every 10-s audio file
# here, we estimate % detections at dawn and dusk, while accounting for sampling effort
vocal_act <- acoustic_data %>%
  group_by(time_of_day, eBird_codes) %>%
  summarise(detections = sum(number)) %>%
  left_join(., species_codes[, c(1, 2, 5)],
    by = "eBird_codes"
  ) %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  mutate(total_detections = sum(detections)) %>%
  mutate(percent_detections = (detections / total_detections) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

## accouting for sampling effort and normalizing data
vocal_act <- vocal_act %>%
  left_join(., effort, by = "time_of_day") %>%
  mutate(normalized_detections = detections / nVisits) %>%
  group_by(eBird_codes) %>%
  mutate(total_normalized_detections = sum(normalized_detections)) %>%
  mutate(percent_normalized_detections = (normalized_detections / total_normalized_detections) * 100) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # in our case, we have 4 species which have 100% detections in dawn, Indian blackbird, Little spiderhunter, Oriental-Magpie Robin and Purple sunbird. For these, we add a additional row specifying no detections in dusk.

  add_row(
    time_of_day = "dusk", eBird_codes = "pursun4", detections = 0, scientific_name = "Cinnyris asiaticus", common_name = "Purple Sunbird", total_detections = 96, percent_detections = 0, normalized_detections = 0,
    percent_normalized_detections = 0, nVisits = 230, total_normalized_detections = 0.6620690
  ) %>%
  add_row(
    time_of_day = "dusk", eBird_codes = "eurbla2", detections = 0, scientific_name = "Turdus simillimus", common_name = "Indian Blackbird", total_detections = 179, percent_detections = 0, normalized_detections = 0,
    percent_normalized_detections = 0, nVisits = 230,
    total_normalized_detections = 1.2344828
  ) %>%
  add_row(
    time_of_day = "dusk", eBird_codes = "litspi1", detections = 0, scientific_name = "Arachnothera longirostra", common_name = "Little Spiderhunter", total_detections = 204, percent_detections = 0,
    normalized_detections = 0, nVisits = 230,
    percent_normalized_detections = 0,
    total_normalized_detections = 1.4068966
  ) %>%
  add_row(
    time_of_day = "dusk", eBird_codes = "magrob", detections = 0, scientific_name = "Copsychus saularis", common_name = "Oriental Magpie-Robin", 
    total_detections = 119, percent_detections = 0,
    normalized_detections = 0, nVisits = 230, 
    percent_normalized_detections = 0,
    total_normalized_detections = 0.6620690
  )
```

## Join the vocal_activity data and territoriality data
```{r}
vocal_act <- vocal_act %>%
  left_join(territoriality, by = "scientific_name") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(territory_cat = case_when(territory %in% "3" ~ "Highly territorial", territory %in% "2" ~ "Weakly territorial", territory %in% "1" ~ "Non-territorial"))
```

There are 19 highly territorial, 11 non-territorial and 39 weakly territorial species in both dawn and dusk.

## Testing the differences between territoriality categories using Wilcoxon test

Here, we see whether there are differences in the vocal activity among highly territorial, weakly territorial and non-territorial species in dawn and dusk individually. 

```{r}
stat.test <- vocal_act %>%
  group_by(time_of_day) %>%
  wilcox_test(percent_normalized_detections ~ territory_cat)
```

Vocal activity is not significantly different across categories of territoriality.
