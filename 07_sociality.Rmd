# Sociality
  
In this script, we examine the role of sociality in vocal activity between dawn and dusk. The expectation is that communal and non-communal signalling species have higher vocal activity in dawn than dusk.

Communal signallers are species that produce long-range acoustic signals in groups, either duets (two individuals) or choruses (three or more individuals) by both males and females. Non-communal signallers are species that sing as single individuals and not communally.

## Testing the differences between socialiaty categories using Wilcoxon test

Here, we see whether there are differences in the vocal activity between communal and non-communal signallers in dawn and dusk individually. 

```{r} 
stat.test <- vocal_act %>% 
  group_by (time_of_day) %>% 
  wilcox_test (percent_normalized_detections ~ sociality_cat)
```

No significant differences were observed in vocal activity between communal signallers and non-communal signallers at dawn or dusk.
